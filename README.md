# Bloodhelp.care
BloodHelp.Care, is an application, which connects a blood donor to blood recipients or their close aides. In our daily life, we come across many events where we are unable to find the blood group match in our blood banks. This app will ease out the hassle to locate/approach the donors. Each user will register themselves on the application and will share their health performa, including blood group and any known active medical condition or history if any . On every emergency case, the push notification will be sent to all the donors available around the area. The blood donation will be point to point, and there will be no involvement of any third party. In this app, the recipient will have to pre-register himself on this application. During the process of pre registration, the user have to declare some group members, especially family members. Now, there are only two parties that can have right to connect to the donors on behalf of the recipient, one is the Recipient and others are the group members. On a single click, all the donors near the calling place, will be informed about the requirement.
